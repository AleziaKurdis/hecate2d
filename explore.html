                    Here's where you generate the list.
                    This is the data that you can use to build each portal:
                    
                        placeList[i].order
                            String (Just a sequence used to establish the current ordering. No expected to be use, the list is already sorted based on it for you when the page get the data.)
                        placeList[i].category
                            String | RUBY/BLUESTEAL/GOLD/SILVER/BRONZE/IRON/STONE (Define some common pattern of section of teh list. example RUBY are the "Featured" place, BLEUSTEAL are the Frequently Visited Place... see Hecate repo for details))
                        placeList[i].accessStatus
                            String | FULL/PEOPLE/{null} (this indicate if there are people or not, or if the domain is full capacity. (Note: We dont suport capacity yet so FULL should not happen for now)
                        placeList[i].name
                            String (This is the name of the Place. We might want a keyword filter based on this content)
                        placeList[i].description
                            String (This is the description of the Place. We might want a keyword filter based on this content)
                        placeList[i].thumbnail
                            String (This is the url of the place picture)
                        placeList[i].maturity
                            String | "unrated", "adult", "mature", "teen", "everyone" (we might want a filter based on that)
                        placeList[i].address
                            String (This is the hifi url of the place. To make a teleporter link, use the function teleport(placeID, address))
                        placeList[i].current_attendance
                            Number (The number of people currently in the Domain. (Maybe one day in the Place))
                        placeList[i].id
                            String (This is the place ID, required to make a teleporter link, use the function teleport(placeID, address))
                        placeList[i].visibility
                            String | 'open', 'friends', 'connections', 'private' (for now only "open" are return by the api, so nothing to do with this. Eventually, if we coudl have something to know if Annonymous are allowed, we could disply but lock the place where anonymous are not welcome, if teh connected user is anonnymous. So they might see an interest to get an account.)
                        placeList[i].capacity
                            Number (Would be the max number of user allowed in the targetted domain. Not supported for now, hardcoded for now to 1000)
